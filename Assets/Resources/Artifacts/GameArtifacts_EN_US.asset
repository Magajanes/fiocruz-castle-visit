    Name: Bust of Oswaldo Cruz
    Description: "Patron of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation and creator of the Moorish
      Castle, Oswaldo Cruz was a scientist with multiple skills and a specialist
      in microbiology. He led the fight against yellow fever in Brazil, implemented
      health and sanitation measures in the city of Rio de Janeiro, and waged a revolution
      in public health in the city, organizing public health policies to fight urban
      problems such as epidemics of bubonic plague, smallpox, and yellow fever. He
      identified the transmissibility of diseases and the need for prevention through
      the population\xB4s vaccination and immunization. Even in the face of widespread
      protests, he organized vaccination campaigns in the early 20th century that
      culminated in the \u201CVaccine Revolt\u201D in 1904. Despite the population\xB4s
      fear and lack of knowledge, in 1908 a new smallpox epidemic led the population
      to show up in droves at the vaccination posts, and Brazil finally acknowledged
      the scientist as a national hero."

    Name: Front Stairway
    Description: "Walls flanking the front stairway with details of the building.
      Built from 1905 to 1918, the FIOCRUZ Castle is a symbol of Brazilian science
      and health. The \u201CScience Palace\u201D, imagined by Oswaldo Cruz as the
      headquarters for the institution that would be named after him, was created
      in the image of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, combining the production of
      vaccines and medicines, scientific research, and other public health activities.
      Located on Rio\xB4s main thoroughfare called Avenida Brasil, the building is
      also known as the Moorish Pavilion or Moorish Castle, due to its Neo-Moorish
      architectural style and the beauty of the Portuguese tiles and mosaics, inspired
      by Arabic tapestry. The Castle was designed by Portuguese architect Luiz Moraes
      J\xFAnior and was listed in 1981 as a heritage stie by the Brazilian National
      Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN)."

    Name: Temperature Controller
    Description: "This curious equipment, more than two meters high, consists of
      a panel with various devices and dials and is an example of advanced technology
      in the early 20th century. The electric temperature controller\xB4s function
      was to continuously record and control the temperature in part of the laboratory
      equipment in the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. The thermometers converted the electric
      current measurements into information on temperature variation."

    Name: Historical vaccination equipment
    Description: The vaccination pistol was invented in 1950 and represented an important
      technological advancement in the global smallpox eradication campaign. The
      portable instrument functioned with a compressed air mechanism activated by
      a pedal and provided a power source of pressure. Without the use of needles,
      the percutaneous vaccine administration functioned through high-pressure flow.

    Name: Photograph of Carlos Chagas
    Description: 'Carlos CPhotograph of Carlos Chagas (1878-1934), Brazilian biologist,
      public health physician, infectious disease expert, and bacteriologist. Carlos
      Chagas was famous for discovering the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and the disease
      it causes, American trypanosomiasis, known as Chagas disease. He was the first
      scientist in history, and the only one to this day, to discover and describe
      all the stages in a single infectious disease: the pathogen (T. cruzi), vector
      (Triatominae), hosts, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology.'

    Name: Microscope used by Carlos Chagas
    Description: "The microscope was used by Carlos Chagas to study triatomine or
      kissing bug number 1. In 1909, Chagas disease was discovered by the Brazilian
      public health physician Carlos Chagas, who was working in the fight against
      malaria at the time in the hinterlands of Minas Gerais state. The pathogen
      or etiological agent of the disease is the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, so
      named by Carlos Chagas as a tribute to the scientist Oswaldo Cruz. The disease
      vector is the triatomine insect or kissing bug. The name \"kissing bug\" is
      because the insect often bites people on the face. Chagas disease is not transmitted
      directly to humans by the insect\xB4s bite. Transmission occurs when the person
      scratches the bite and the feces eliminated by the bug penetrate the skin through
      the wound. Transmission can also occur through transfusion of contaminated
      blood and from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Brazil has also recorded cases
      of infection by the oral route in persons that consumed sugar cane juice or
      a\xE7a\xED contaminated by these insects."

      the Natural History of Brazil, by Willem Piso and Georg Marggraf, entitled
      Historia Naturalis Brasiliae (1648). Another outstanding work is a Jesuit manuscript
      from the year 1703 that contains the description of various herbs and recipes
      used to treat diseases in the inhabitants of Brazil during the Colonial Period.
      A collection of documents from the 19th century is attributed to travelers
      who visited Brazil and other lands of the Americas, leaving numerous annotations
      and illustrations of landscapes and the customs of various peoples.

    Name: Costa Lima Exhibit Room
    Description: "Angelo Moreira da Costa Lima (1887-1964) is considered the patron
      of studies on insects in Brazil. In the early 20th century, he studied at the
      School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro and worked as an academic assistant at
      the Yellow Fever Prophylaxis Service created by Oswaldo Cruz, the main purpose
      of which was to fight the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In 1910, after concluding
      his studies, Costa Lima worked in the fight against yellow fever in the state
      of Par\xE1, where he conducted detailed studies on culicids, mosquitos found
      in the region and that transmit the disease. From 1938 to 1962, the entomologist
      produced his most important work, entitled Insetos do Brasil (Insects of Brazil).
      The collection includes a major portion of the insect species studied by Costa
      Lima and to this day serves as a research source for entomologists and as a
      beautiful example of science dissemination."

    Name: Photograph of Oswaldo Cruz
    Description: "Oswaldo Cruz was the first president of the institution and called
      his dream the \"Science Palace\", a dream that came true and that became the
      headquarters of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ). Built from 1905 to 1918,
      the FIOCRUZ Castle is a symbol of science and health in Brazil, created under
      the inspiration of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, dedicated to the production
      of vaccines and medicines, scientific research, and other public health activities
      in Brazil. Located next to Rio\xB4s main thoroughfare called Avenida Brasil,
      the building is also known as the Moorish Pavilion or Moorish Castle because
      of its Neo-Moorish style, with beautiful Portuguese tiles and mosaics inspired
      by Arabic tapestry. The Castle was designed by Portuguese architect Luiz Moraes
      J\xFAnior and was listed in 1981 as a heritage site by the National Institute
      of Historical and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN)."

    Name: Lithograph of the Castle
    Description: "Considered the key symbol of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the Castle
      that celebrated 100 years in 2018 was conceived by the scientist Oswaldo Cruz
      himself, who drew the first sketches, and by Portuguese architect Luiz Moraes
      J\xFAnior. The Moorish Castle celebrated its centennial having fulfilled its
      mission as the icon of development of science and public health in Brazil.
      The Castle has a total of 160,000 square feet of floor space, with materials
      largely imported from Germany, France, England, and Portugal and the use of
      modern building technique. Oswaldo Cruz (1872\u20131917) launched his scientific
      mission and dream at 30 years of age on the former Manguinhos farm, situated
      in the Inha\xFAma neighborhood on the outskirts of Rio, with the initial name
      of Federal Serotherapeutic Institute. He spared no effort to fulfill an apparently
      impossible dream to build a grand Castle to house Brazil\xB4s new and incipient
      science. The Moorish Castle was built from 1905 to 1918 on a hillside on the
      farm, facing Guanabara Bay, replacing the former improvised installations of
      the Federal Serotherapeutic Institute, created on May 25, 1900. The architectural
      style characterizing the Moorish Pavilion received three main influences: The
      first was the Palais du Bardo in Parc Montsouris in Paris, which Oswaldo Cruz
      visited when he was studying in France. The palace marked the presence of the
      Neo-Moorish style, highly valued in late 19th-century Europe. The second influence
      was the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. The third and principal influence
      was the New Synagogue in Berlin, which inspired other synagogues around the
      world and the towers on the Castle of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute."

    Name: Castle Tower
    Description: "The Castle towers drew inspiration from the New Synagogue in Berlin.
      While work began on the foundations of the central building in 1905, the terrace
      and towers were only finalized starting in 1910, and even with the work still
      under way that year, the Castle was already occupied by the researchers. The
      towers are the highest point on the institution and provide a 360\xBA view
      of the campus and beyond."

      Cruz Institute. The construction of the Moorish Pavilion used glass panes,
      rooftiles, furnishings, marble, ironwork, and lamps imported from Europe. Most
      of the materials came by boat and were offloaded on a pier installed on Guanabara
      Bay, which at the time reached what is now Rio\xB4s main thoroughfare called
      Avenida Brasil, inaugurated in 1947."
